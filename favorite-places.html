                <p>Landmark Beach Lagos is a private, recreational beach resort in Victoria Island, Nigeria. 
                It was founded by Paul Onwuanibe as a key part of the larger Landmark Village. The beach offers various leisure activities, from water sports to dining. Recently, a portion of the beach was demolished to make way for the Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway.</p>
